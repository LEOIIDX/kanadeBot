During one of our meetups, the seat fell off of the cross-shaped mounting. Other patrons of the course began hanging off of the cross-shaped mounting. Eventually, a man who coincidently looked like Jesus got to the hole. As he was hanging off the bar, the bar fell off onto his head. The bar seemed to have injured his head since he was bleeding from it.",
