persona 5~It’s also important to acknowledge your shortcomings as a reviewer. Mine personally is that I have no fucking patience at all. Pretty much throw any RPG at me. I’m just going to say ‘Nah, that’s... that’s boring.’ But you know what’s dumber than RPGs? Anime. Unless we’re talking this guy [referring to Hayao Miyazaki], you need to get this bullshit out of my face. But you know what I hate much, much more than anime? Turn based combat. For real, I despise this shit. There’s like two games that figured out how to make it fun [referring to Paper Mario and Undertale], but those don’t count. Turn-based combat is fucking boring, tedious, and draining. It is the opposite of fun. So when I say Persona 5, a turn-based, anime RPG, is actually pretty fun, you should go ‘Damn, okay, maybe that game is alright.
