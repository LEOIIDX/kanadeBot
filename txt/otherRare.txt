1~Glasses are really versatile. First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist\'s glasses and putting them on like, "Haha, got your glasses!\' That\'s just way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that suspicious looking gleam, and it\'s amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke. I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It\'s actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It\'s like you\'re enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet. I really want Luna to try some on or Marine to try some on to replace her eyepatch. We really need glasses to become a thing in hololive and start selling them for HoloComi. Don\'t. You. Think. We. Really. Need. To. Officially. Give. Everyone. Glasses?

3~Hey guys, did you know that in terms of male human and female Pokémon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pokémon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more

5~It’s also important to acknowledge your shortcomings as a reviewer. Mine personally is that I have no fucking patience at all. Pretty much throw any RPG at me. I’m just going to say ‘Nah, that’s... that’s boring.’ But you know what’s dumber than RPGs? Anime. Unless we’re talking this guy [referring to Hayao Miyazaki], you need to get this bullshit out of my face. But you know what I hate much, much more than anime? Turn based combat. For real, I despise this shit. There’s like two games that figured out how to make it fun [referring to Paper Mario and Undertale], but those don’t count. Turn-based combat is fucking boring, tedious, and draining. It is the opposite of fun. So when I say Persona 5, a turn-based, anime RPG, is actually pretty fun, you should go ‘Damn, okay, maybe that game is alright.
