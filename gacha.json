I love her so much that it is inexplicable, and I'm ninety-nine percent sure that I have an unhealthy obsession. I will never get tired of listening that sweet, angelic voice of hers. It is my life goal to meet up her with her in real life and just say hello to her.", "I fall asleep at night dreaming of her holding a personal concert for me, and then she would be sorry tired that she comes and cuddles up to me while we sleep together. If I could just hold her hand for a brief moment, I could die happy. If given the opportunity, I would lightly nibble on her ear just to hear what kind of sweet moans she would let out. Then, I would hug her while she clings to my body hoping that I would stop, but I only continue as she moans louder and louder.", "I would give up almost anything just for her to look in my general direction. No matter what I do, I am constantly thinking of her. When I wake up, she is the first thing on my mind. When I go to school, I can only focus on her. When I go come home, I go on the computer so that I can listen to her beautiful voice. When I go to sleep, I dream of her and I living a happy life together. She is my pride, passion, and joy. If she were to call me 'Onii-chan,' I would probably get diabetes from her sweetness and die.", "I wish for nothing but her happiness. If it were for her, I would give my life without any second thoughts. Without her, my life would serve no purpose. I really love Nanahira."]

First, you can have glasses-wearing girls take them off and suddenly become beautiful, or have girls wearing glasses flashing those cute grins, or have girls stealing the protagonist's glasses and putting them on like, 'Haha, got your glasses!' That's just way too cute! Also, boys with glasses! I really like when their glasses have that suspicious looking gleam, and it's amazing how it can look really cool or just be a joke. I really like how it can fulfill all those abstract needs. Being able to switch up the styles and colors of glasses based on your mood is a lot of fun too! It's actually so much fun! You have those half rim glasses, or the thick frame glasses, everything! It's like you're enjoying all these kinds of glasses at a buffet.

Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3”03’ tall and 63.9 pounds, this means they’re large enough to be able handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base Stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there’s no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll Eyes, Captivate, Charm, and Tail Whip, along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it’d be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and Hydration, they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pokémon comes close to this level of compatibility. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat+high HP pool+Acid Armor means it can take cock all day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more"]

Unless we’re talking this guy [referring to Hayao Miyazaki], you need to get this bullshit out of my face. But you know what I hate much, much more than anime? Turn based combat. For real, I despise this shit. There’s like two games that figured out how to make it fun [referring to Paper Mario and Undertale], but those don’t count. Turn-based combat is fucking boring, tedious, and draining. It is the opposite of fun.

Everytime I open my door, the bottom part of it hits the wall and makes a sound that is just so fucking annoying. Also the fact that i have to use a broom to keep it closed to a certain point because when I open it, it’ll slowly start to close itself again because it’s angled just enough for it to slide. If I don’t use a broom or something to keep it at that certain point, it will have a gap inbetween the wall and door and you can just see into my room. Also the maximum distance it can be opened is blocked by an air vent so when i open it too hard it’ll just slam into the vent and make a really annoying sound. The wheels at the top of the door can be taken off the rail so easily too, my dog has knocked it down before. The two handles aren’t the same. The one on the inside of my room is an easy open, the one on the outside is just a gap of space that’s like less than half an inch so I have to jam my finger to try and open my door. It also doesn’t help that sometimes when it goes too far out of place, i can basically not open my door from the outside and there’s that stupid gap that i was talking about. It makes me angry"]
